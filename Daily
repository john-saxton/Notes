-Ask doug about OI load, quotes for 2x homes - ARGON-1632
   quote is obtained, needs SFP modules added
   hoping to resolve OI load on Purley before putting in order
-quote for HP JBOD argon scratch
  joe hadn't forwarded contact info on this

+storage01 winbind (worked on but not finished by a long shot)
  * winbind sort of works, but unable to connect to samba share. I suspect
    hostname differences may be at play. The interface 172.30.13.24 is
    itf-rs-storage01.its.uiowa.edu but puppet and AD are configured with
    itf-rs-storage01.hpc.uiowa.edu.

+OI Booting
  #Hyper-Threading:
  Advanced tab > "CPU Configuration"
  Set to Disabled

  #4G Encoding:
  Advanced tab > "PCIe/PCI/PnP Configuration"
  The setting is actually "Above 4G Decoding"  [Disabled]

  It does not look like xhci0 is in our current BIOS settings.
  This probably has to do with disabling the usb 3 xhci driver.

  Also trying ACPI -> WHEA support to Disabled and Intel VT-d IO passthrough to disabled
  BSD BTX bootloader manual https://people.freebsd.org/~jhb/docs/loader.txt

  All result in complete failure to boot OI
