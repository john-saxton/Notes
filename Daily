-Ask doug about OI load, quotes for 2x homes - ARGON-1632
   quote is obtained, needs SFP modules added
   hoping to resolve OI load on Purley before putting in order
-quote for HP JBOD argon scratch
  joe hadn't forwarded contact info on this

+storage01 winbind (worked on but not finished by a long shot)
  * winbind sort of works, but unable to connect to samba share. I suspect
    hostname differences may be at play. The interface 172.30.13.24 is
    itf-rs-storage01.its.uiowa.edu but puppet and AD are configured with
    itf-rs-storage01.hpc.uiowa.edu.

+OI Booting
  #Hyper-Threading:
  Advanced tab > "CPU Configuration"
  Set to Disabled

  #4G Encoding:
  Advanced tab > "PCIe/PCI/PnP Configuration"
  The setting is actually "Above 4G Decoding"  [Disabled]

  It does not look like xhci0 is in our current BIOS settings.
  This probably has to do with disabling the usb 3 xhci driver.

  Also trying ACPI -> WHEA support to Disabled and Intel VT-d IO passthrough to disabled
  BSD BTX bootloader manual https://people.freebsd.org/~jhb/docs/loader.txt

  All result in complete failure to boot OI

    trying to get storage01 talking to puppet, thinking about having sssd use

    command to call login_duo with the right username string
-znapzend stopped for compliant because inotify watches ran out
    need to look in to way to be notified when it fails. there are pre and post
    command config options that could check for completion somehow.

    continued failure, tried creating USB drive per handbook instructions, no joy
    tried pulling all disks
    tried rewriting usb installer without header file per wiki...this works
    boot is hanging on cpu drivers it appears
+znapzend stopped for compliant because inotify watches ran out
    turned out my custom sysctl.d config file contained a typo which caused this
