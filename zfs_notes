Destroy snapshots with holds:
potentialy multiple holds per snapshot, so programmatically read in the holds and release them, then delete:
  for i in `zfs list -Hrt snapshot [dataset] | awk '{print $1}'`; do for j in `zfs holds -H $i | awk '{print $2}'`; do zfs release $j $i; done; zfs destroy -nv $i; done

Scrub tuning:
This is a full notes dump; you won’t care about the first bit that you put in /etc/system, since that’s what effects changes to the behavior at boot.

The latter with mdb are what you’ll want

# Scrub speedups
The /etc/system changes are straight forward:

* Prioritize resilvering by setting the delay to zero
set zfs:zfs_resilver_delay = 0

* Prioritize scrubs by setting the delay to zero
set zfs:zfs_scrub_delay = 0

* set maximum number of inflight IOs to a reasonable value - this number will vary for your environment
set zfs:zfs_top_maxinflight = 128

* resilver for five seconds per TXG
set zfs:zfs_resilver_min_time_ms = 5000

The default value here is three seconds. By giving resilver five seconds per transaction group we can rebuild the mirror more quickly.

Now, to make these changes take effect immediately so you dont have to reboot, you can execute the following:

echo zfs_resilver_delay/w0 | mdb -kw
echo zfs_scrub_delay/w0 |mdb -kw
echo zfs_top_maxinflight/w7f |mdb -kw
echo zfs_resilver_min_time_ms/w1388 |mdb -kw

These variables and more can be found in dsl_scan.c

        echo 'zfs_scrub_delay/D' | mdb -k
        echo 'zfs_scan_idle/D' | mdb -k

Will show you current values: defaults are:

root@lc-rs-storage03:/etc/inet# echo 'zfs_scrub_delay/D' | mdb -k
zfs_scrub_delay:
zfs_scrub_delay:4            

root@lc-rs-storage03:/etc/inet#  echo 'zfs_scan_idle/D' | mdb -k  
zfs_scan_idle:
zfs_scan_idle:  50      

You can play with the numbers a bit, but I found that if I set scan_idle 
echo 'zfs_scan_idle/W0t20'| sudo mdb -kw


and scrub delay
echo 'zfs_scrub_delay/W0t0' | sudo mdb -kw

It would speed up the scrub significantly.

On a non-sick system (or really busy one) you may only have to adjust

scrub_delay subtly, say to 2, and maybe leave scan_idle at 50, or adjust it to 30 or 40 to see an increase.
it to 30 or 40 to see an increase.
